- Hi, I'm Rothy and I like programming stuff. 

- My weapons of choice are c#/c++/c.
- I like game development.
- Interested in SDL, OpenGL and the WinApi
- I am more of a generalist than a specialist.
- Building game engines is cool.
- Other skills: 3D modeling, Unity, some substance painter and a splashing of Japanese on the side (日本語大丈夫ですが、私はまずいです。).

- Things that I am currently learning/trying to improve on.

- General programming skills in C/C++.
- Improving my knowledge on the STL, CRT and WinAPI.
- Improving my SDL and OpenGL skills.

- Collaborating
- I would be mostly interested in collabing on projects using c/c++ with a focus on game development, game tools development or 3D engine development
in SDL/OpenGL.
